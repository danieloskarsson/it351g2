# Course introductionn

### Teachers

In this course there are two \(2\) teachers and supervisors: Marcus Brohede \(brom\) and Daniel Oskarsson \(oskd\), as well as two \(2\) additional supervisors: Johan Bjuren \(bjuj\), and Tobias Löf Melker \(lofu\). Henrik Gustavsson \(gush\) is the examiner for the course

### Classes

There are 24 classes and an equal amount of supervised sessions. 14 of those classes start with a lecture that lasts ~10-60 minutes. The last two weeks of the course ends with a project seminar followed by a home exam the following week. The dates and times for all classes are listed in TimeEdit.

{% hint style="danger" %}
To minimize the spread of COVID-19 lectures and supervised sessions are given via Discord according to the schedule. 1-many lectures are provided via audio only in the voice channel \#lectures. Only the material on LenaSys will be covered in the lectures. 1-1 help is offered using a queue system where the student asks for help in \#handledningskö.
{% endhint %}

The point of the 1-many audio lectures is to improve the material on LenaSys and decrease the pressure on 1-1 supervised sessions. Please read through the material before taking part of the lecture and feel free to interrupt with your questions during the lectures if you believe the answers can be used to improve the material on LenaSys.

### Examination
