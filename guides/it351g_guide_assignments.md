# Assignments \(sv. duggor\)

 There are three \(4\) things that must always be handed in for every assignment:

* Link to the latest commit of the assignment on Github
  * e.g. `https://github.com/b02danos/WebViewApp/tree/f2c7b40e43078d16f326ef20be7df719c5b4f8e6`
* ZIP-file of the content of the assignment from Github
  * e.g. `b02danos-WebViewApp-f2c7b40e43078d16f326ef20be7df719c5b4f8e6.zip`
* PDF-file with a short report where you explain the things that you have done.
  * e.g. `b02danos-WebViewApp-f2c7b40e43078d16f326ef20be7df719c5b4f8e6.pdf`
* APK-file where the content of the assignment has been compiled in Android Studio
  * e.g. `b02danos-WebViewApp-debug-f2c7b40e43078d16f326ef20be7df719c5b4f8e6.apk`

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that the files must be prefixed with your university username and all four artifacts must to contain the same git commit hash! E.g. `b02danos-` and `f2c7b40e43078d16f326ef20be7df719c5b4f8e6` in the examples above.
{% endhint %}

The report should be _very_ short. Copy and paste relevant code from your project into the report and write a short paragraph of text \(a few lines of text\) that describes the idea behind the code. The report must also include at least one screenshot of the app that should be referenced in the text.

* Use the report template from the course page.
* Reports with no code will be failed.
* Reports with code and no or very little text describing the code will be failed.

{% hint style="info" %}
For the Tools & Services and Project repository assignments you need to create a new project in Android Studio and share it on Github. For all other assignments you need to fork the existing repositories from Marcus and clone them in Android Studio.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Each assignments should consist of more than one commit. The project will be rejected if there are too few commits.
{% endhint %}
